Title: Understanding Web Requests and Responses



**1. Request-Response Model or Client-Server Architecture**
   - Whenever you access a Web server, the client (browser) sends a request to the server.
   - The server responds by sending back the requested data or Web page.
   - This process remains consistent, whether accessing a whole Web page or data from a Web API.

**2. Domain Name and DNS**
   - Every URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS for the protocol.
   - The domain name (e.g., restcountries.eu) is a human-friendly alias for the server's actual IP address.
   - Domain Name Servers (DNS) act as internet phone books, converting domain names to IP addresses.

**3. TCP and IP**
   - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are fundamental communication protocols that govern data transfer on the internet.
   - They manage how data travels across the Web, breaking it into packets for efficient transmission and reassembling them at their destination.

**4. HTTP Request**
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is another communication protocol used for client-server communication.
   - An HTTP request contains:
     - Start line with the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) used, request target, and HTTP version.
     - Request headers with information about the request itself.
     - Request body (if sending data).

**5. HTTP Response**
   - An HTTP response is similar in structure to a request, including start line, headers, and body.
   - The start line contains a status code indicating the success or failure of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for page not found).

**6. HTTPS**
   - HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP encrypted using TLS or SSL.
   - The logic behind HTTP requests and responses applies to HTTPS as well.

**7. Multiple Requests for Web Pages**
   - When accessing a web page, the initial request fetches the HTML file.
   - The browser then scans the HTML for required assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).
   - A new HTTP request is made for each asset, leading to multiple requests and responses.
   - These requests may occur simultaneously but are limited to prevent connection slowdown.

**8. TCP/IP and Data Transmission**
   - TCP breaks data into packets for efficient transmission, reassembling them at the destination.
   - IP handles the routing of packets using IP addresses.

**Conclusion**
   - This overview provides insight into how the Web operates behind the scenes.
   - Understanding these processes can be valuable for developers, even though they don't manually write HTTP requests.

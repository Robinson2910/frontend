Here's a summary of the key points 

**Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript:**

- Asynchronous JavaScript is essential for tasks that should not block the main code execution.
- Synchronous code executes line by line in the order defined in the code.
- Synchronous code can cause issues when one line takes a long time to execute, as it blocks the entire process(example alert).
- Asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background, enabling the main code to continue without waiting for them to finish.

**Asynchronous JavaScript:**

- Asynchronous JavaScript involves using callback functions that execute after specific tasks complete.
- Callback functions alone do not make code asynchronous; it's the asynchronous behavior of the task they're associated with that matters.
- Examples of asynchronous behavior include timers (e.g., `setTimeout`) and loading images in the background.

**Ajax Calls and Web APIs:**

- Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows communication with remote web servers asynchronously.
- Ajax is used to request data from a server without reloading the page.
- Online APIs, also known as web APIs, are applications running on web servers that provide data in response to requests.
- 3rd-party APIs are APIs made available by other developers, often for free.
- APIs are widely used to access various types of data, such as weather, currency conversion, flights, and more.
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most popular data format for APIs, as it is easy to send and parse in JavaScript.

**Conclusion:**

- Asynchronous JavaScript is crucial for non-blocking code execution and handling tasks that take time to complete.
- Ajax calls to web APIs are common use cases for asynchronous JavaScript in web development.

These notes should serve as a condensed reference for the key concepts discussed in the video transcript. You can further refine and organize these notes based on your specific needs and preferences.



 The base URL of the API used throughout this section has changed

It's not a big deal, it's really just one small change. Instead of:

https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/

It's now:

https://countries-api-836d.onrender.com/countries/

So whenever we use the Countries API in this section, please just change the URL you see in the videos to this new one.

Happy learning ✌️

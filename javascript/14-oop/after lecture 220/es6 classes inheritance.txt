### Implementing Inheritance with ES6 Classes

1. **Introduction:**
   - The goal is to implement inheritance using ES6 classes instead of constructor functions.
   - ES6 classes provide a more abstract and cleaner syntax, hiding some details happening behind the scenes.

2. **Creating the Parent Class:**
   - Start with a basic class, e.g., `Person`, that has properties like `firstName`, `birthYear`, and methods like `calcAge`.
   - The class syntax is a layer of abstraction over constructor functions.

3. **Creating the Child Class:**
   - Create a new class, e.g., `Student`, to inherit from the `Person` class.
   - Use the `extends` keyword followed by the parent class name (`extends Person`).
   - Define a constructor in the child class that receives additional parameters specific to the child class, e.g., `course`.
   - Inside the child class constructor, call `super(...)` to invoke the parent class constructor and set up the `this` keyword.

4. **Constructor Execution Order:**
   - Always call `super()` first in the child class constructor.
   - The `super` function is the parent class constructor.

5. **Optional Constructor:**
   - If the child class doesn't need additional properties, a constructor is not mandatory.
   - The child class inherits all properties and methods from the parent class automatically.

6. **Instance Creation:**
   - Create an instance of the child class, e.g., `const martha = new Student('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science')`.

7. **Method Inheritance:**
   - Child class instances inherit methods from the parent class.
   - Methods like `introduce` and `calcAge` work seamlessly on instances of the child class.

8. **Override a Method:**
   - Demonstrate method overriding in the child class.
   - For example, override the `calcAge` method to show a student's perceived age in a university context.

9. **Prototype Chain:**
   - Inspect the prototype chain to see that it's automatically set up by the `extends` keyword.
   - Child class methods appear first, shadowing those of the parent class.

10. **Caution on Inheritance:**
   - Acknowledge that inheritance, while powerful, can be problematic in real-world software design.
   - Issues with tight coupling and potential pitfalls are highlighted.

11. **Closing Remarks:**
    - Emphasize the importance of understanding the theory behind inheritance between classes, as covered in previous lectures.
    - Mention that the explored inheritance mechanism will be discussed further in the context of functional programming.

### Conclusion:
Understanding how to implement inheritance using ES6 classes is crucial for effective object-oriented programming in JavaScript. While the syntax is cleaner, developers should be cautious about potential issues related to inheritance in real-world software design. The exploration of this mechanism sets the stage for discussions on alternatives like functional programming.

code:
// Parent Class: Person
class Person {
  // Constructor with properties
  constructor(firstName, birthYear) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;
  }

  // Method to calculate age
  calcAge() {
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    this.age = currentYear - this.birthYear;
    console.log(`${this.firstName} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Child Class: Student
class Student extends Person {
  // Constructor with additional properties
  constructor(firstName, birthYear, course) {
    // Call the parent class constructor using super
    super(firstName, birthYear);
    
    // Additional property for the child class
    this.course = course;
  }

  // Override the calcAge method
  calcAge() {
    // Customized age calculation for a student
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    const perceivedAge = currentYear - this.birthYear + 10;
    console.log(`${this.firstName} feels more like ${perceivedAge} years old as a student.`);
  }

  // Method specific to the Student class
  study() {
    console.log(`${this.firstName} is studying ${this.course}.`);
  }
}

// Create instances of the classes
const martha = new Student('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science');

// Call methods on instances
martha.calcAge(); // Output: Martha feels more like 20 years old as a student.
martha.study();   // Output: Martha is studying Computer Science.

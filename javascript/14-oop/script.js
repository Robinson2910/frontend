// class are blueprints of objects

// 4 principles must be followed during oop

// abstraction: hiding the unimportant details

//Enacapsualtion:keeping proeprties and methods privates inside the class,so they are not accessible from outside the class.Some methods can be exposed
//as a public interface(API)

//inheritance
//one class can inherit from other

//child class inherits all properties and method from parent

//child class has its own properties as well as that of parents

//polymorphism:A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from parent class

// all objects in js are linked to prototype object

// prototyoe object contains methods ,all the objects linked to prototype object can use

//this behavior is called prototypal Inheritance:The prototype contains methods(behavior) that are accecisbe to all object linked to that prototype

//behavor(methods) is delegated to the linked prototype object

//how do implment oop in js

//1.constructor function
//technique to create objects from a fn

//this is how built in fn like arrays ,maps,sets are actually implemented

//2.ES6 Classes

//3)Object.creat()

//creating objects from constructor function

// A constructor function in JavaScript is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. 
//It's like a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar properties and methods. 
//When you use a constructor function to create an object, you are essentially defining a class from which you can create instances (objects) with shared characteristics.

// Here's how you can create a constructor function and use it to create objects:

// Define a constructor function for creating Person objects
function Person2(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;

  // You can also define methods within the constructor
  this.sayHello = function () {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  };
}

// Create instances (objects) using the constructor
var person1 = new Person2('Alice', 30);
var person2 = new Person2('Bob', 25);

// Access properties and methods of the objects
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person2.age); // Output: 25
person1.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."

const Person = function (fullName, birthYear) {
  console.log(this);
  //Instance properties
  this.fullName = fullName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;

  //never create a method inside a constructor fn(as 1000s of objects will be there..we will also create 1000 copies of that fn)

  // this.calcAge = function () {
  //   console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
  // };
};

//static fns(can only be accesed using the constructor name or className not using their objects)
Person.hey = function () {
  console.log('Hey there ðŸ™Œ');
};
Person.hey();

// jonas.hey();//cant be used

const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1991); //calling the fn with new operator
//1.new empty object will be created rightaway

//2.afterwards function is called and this keyword is set to newly created object(this={})

//3.{} obj linked to prototype  (__proto__ = Person.prototype)  When you create an object using a constructor function, such as new Person(), the new object inherits from the prototype of that constructor.

// prototyoe object contains methods ,all the objects linked to prototype object can use

//4. function automatically returns  {}
console.dir(Person);
// console.log(jonas.hey());


console.log(jonas);

const matilda = new Person('Matilda', 2017); //instance of person

const jack = new Person('Jack', 1975);

console.log(matilda, jack);

console.log(jonas instanceof Person);
// console.log(jaybro instanceof Person);

//Prototypes

// each and every fn in js has prototype property  that includes the constructor fn

//hence the objects created using constructor fn(it is linked to prototype of the constructor fn) also has acces to protype property

console.log(Person.prototype);

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
};

//since the objects or instance of person has acces to prototype object and its methods

jonas.calcAge(); //this way will work even though jonas doesnt contain calcAge method

//we have acces to it because of prototypal inheritance

// all of the instance or objects created using the constructor fn can basically use the calcAge fn

console.log(jonas.__proto__);

// In simple words, a prototype in JavaScript is like a blueprint or template for objects. It's an object itself that contains shared properties and methods that other objects can inherit. Think of it as a set of instructions for creating similar objects with common characteristics. Objects created from the same prototype share these characteristics, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype); //Person.prototype is not the prototype of person,but instead,it is what its gonna be used as the prototype of all objects that are created with person constructor fn

console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas));

Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';

console.log(jonas.species, matilda.species);

console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('fullName'));
console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('species'));

console.log(jonas.__proto__);
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__);
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__);

// .prototype is used to point the prototype object
// .constructor is used to point back at the constructor fn
console.dir(Person.prototype.constructor);

const arr = [3, 3, 3, 2, 2]; //new Array===[]
//new Array is the construtor used to create arrays(Abstraction)

console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype);
console.log(arr.__proto__);
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__);

//generally not a good idea to expand the inbuilt prototype
Array.prototype.unique = function () {
  return [...new Set(this)];
};

console.log(arr.unique());

//all dom elements are bts objects    bts implies behind the scenes
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
// console.dir(h1);
console.dir(h1);

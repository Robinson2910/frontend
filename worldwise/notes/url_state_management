is an excellent place to store ui state and an alternative to useState in some situations!

example:open/closed panels,currently selected list item,list sorting order,applied list filters

why we want to place state in url

1. easy way to store state in a global place,accesible to all components in the app

2.Good way to pass data from one page into next page

3. Makes it possible to bookmark and share the page with exact ui state it had at the time

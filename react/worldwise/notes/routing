with routing we match different url to different ui views(react components):routes

this enables us to navigate between different application screens,using the browser url

Keeps ui in sync with current browsser url

react-router (npm i react-router-dom) most important third party library

routing is fundament for buliding spa

application that is exected entirely on client is called spa

spa rely heavily on concept of routes where different url correspond to different views(components)

whenever use clicks the router link,url is changed
In react this is done by reac-router

//changin url will then trigger the dom to be updated as result

//in spa it is always javacript that will update the dom and therefore the page

=>the page is never reloaded

=>it feels like a native app

additonal data might be loaded from a web api

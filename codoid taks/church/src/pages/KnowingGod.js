            God is Holy, and man in his best form with all his goodness, cannot come into the
            presence of a Holy God. Man has to be free from the bondage and slavery of sin.If we
            continue in sin then we also have to receive punishment for our sins. God is just and
            being just He has to punish us for all the wrong that we do.

            If we continue in sin, then according to{" "}
            <span className="highlight">
              Rom 6:23, the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through
              Christ Jesus our Lord.

          <p className="para margin-bottom-small">
            So we are due to receive punishment for the many sins we have committed. On the other
            hand, God is Love and He does not want anyone to be destroyed or separated from Him. The
            love of God beckons us, but His Holiness prevents us from coming to Him and we are due
            punishment as He is just. Then how could sinful man gain access or entrance into the
            presence of a God who is Holy and fair? Let me give an illustration.

            <span className="highlight">A Story:</span> A man was caught by the police for robbery
            and was produced before the court. The Judge happened to be his friend. But being a just
            person, he passed the judgment. The man had to pay a fine of Rs.500/- or be in jail for
            7 days. After pronouncing the judgment, the Judge himself came down and paid the amount
            of Rs. 500/- on behalf of his friend, advising him not to rob again. Now the judge had
            released his friend from the punishment due. In this manner, the judge was able to meet
            both ends. He was the judge as well as the deliverer. (Illustration from Sam Doherty's
            Sunday School teaching)

            This is what God did. God is Love, Just, and Holy. He could not deny Himself. But He
            also made a way. God destroyed sin’s control over our life. So what is the way by which
            we sinful people can reach God who is just and holy? God sent His only son, Jesus
            Christ, to take the punishment for our sins, God through His son Jesus Christ, opened a
            new way for us to come to Him. God put upon Jesus the entire punishment of the sins of
            the whole world, the sicknesses, and all the unlawful deeds committed by everyone.

            The Bible says in <span className="highlight">Isa 53:5:</span>
          </p>
          <blockquote className="para highlight margin-bottom-small">
            But he was wounded and crushed for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace. He
            was whipped, and we were healed!
          </blockquote>
          <p className="para margin-bottom-small">
            We should have been punished, but Jesus Christ died in our place and took our sins and
            sicknesses on His body.So through Jesus, we can come into the presence of God the
            Father. Jesus is the way to God the Father.
